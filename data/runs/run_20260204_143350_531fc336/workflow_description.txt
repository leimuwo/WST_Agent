The workflow configuration defines a code interpreter application designed for understanding and explaining code step by step. The application is set up in chat mode, using the Qwen3-8B model from the SiliconFlow provider. It does not support agent mode or external data tools. File uploads are disabled, and no sensitive word filtering is applied. The opening statement invites users to input code they want explained, with a prompt that asks the model to act as a code interpreter. The configuration is structured to support simple interaction without complex features like retrieval or multi-turn conversations.
