The workflow configuration defines a code interpreter application designed for understanding and explaining code. It is set up as a chat-based interface with no active agent mode, meaning it does not perform iterative reasoning or function calls. The application uses the Qwen/Qwen3-8B model provided by the SiliconFlow platform. It includes an opening statement to guide users in inputting code for explanation. File upload is disabled, and there are no external data tools or dataset configurations. The application is intended for straightforward code interpretation tasks without complex interactions or data retrieval.
