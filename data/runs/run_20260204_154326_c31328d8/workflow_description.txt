The workflow configuration defines a code interpreter application designed for understanding and explaining code step by step. The application is set to operate in chat mode, with no active agent mode enabled. It uses the Qwen3-8B model provided by the SiliconFlow platform. The application allows users to input code for explanation and provides an opening statement guiding the user on how to proceed. File upload functionality is disabled, and there are no external data tools or retrieval resources configured. The application does not support speech-to-text or text-to-speech features, nor does it include any sensitive word filtering or suggested questions.
