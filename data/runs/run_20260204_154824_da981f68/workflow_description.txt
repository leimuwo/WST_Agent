The workflow configuration defines a code interpreter application designed for understanding and explaining code step by step. It is set up as a chat-based interface with no active agent mode, meaning it does not perform iterative reasoning or function calls. The application uses the Qwen3-8B model provided by the SiliconFlow platform. It allows users to input code for explanation, with a predefined opening statement prompting the user to provide the code they want to understand. File upload functionality is disabled, and there are no external data tools or retrieval resources enabled. The configuration also includes settings for prompt types, conversation history handling, and other interaction-related parameters.
