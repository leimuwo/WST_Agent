The workflow configuration defines a code interpreter application designed for understanding and explaining code. It is set up as a chat-based interface with the model 'Qwen/Qwen3-8B' from the provider 'langgenius/siliconflow/siliconflow'. The application does not support any external data tools, file uploads, or speech-to-text features. It includes an opening statement and a pre-prompt to guide users in providing code for interpretation. The configuration disables several advanced features such as agent mode, retrieval resources, and sensitive word avoidance. The application is intended to be used in a simple chat format without complex interactions.
