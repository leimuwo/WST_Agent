The workflow configuration defines a chat-based application named '代码解释器' (Code Interpreter) that is designed to assist users in understanding code by clarifying its syntax and semantics. The application uses the Qwen3-8B model provided by the SiliconFlow platform. It operates in a chat mode, with no enabled agent mode or external data tools. File upload is disabled, and the application does not support speech-to-text or text-to-speech features. The opening statement invites users to input code they wish to understand, and the pre-prompt sets the context for the code interpreter role.
