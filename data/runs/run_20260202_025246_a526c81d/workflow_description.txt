The workflow configuration defines a code interpreter application designed for understanding and explaining code step by step. It is built using the SiliconFlow platform, with the Qwen3-8B model as the core component. The application operates in chat mode, allowing users to input code for interpretation. It supports file uploads of various image and video formats but does not enable features such as speech-to-text, text-to-speech, or data retrieval. The configuration also disables several advanced features like agent mode, annotation replies, and sensitive word avoidance. The application's opening statement invites users to provide code for explanation.
